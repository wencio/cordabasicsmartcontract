# cordabasicsmartcontract
Here's an example of a simple Corda application that implements a basic smart contract.
This example demonstrates a basic Corda contract that implements a simple state with a single string value "data". The contract defines two commands, 
"Create" and "Update", and implements basic verification logic to ensure that the correct number 
of inputs and outputs are consumed and produced, respectively.
